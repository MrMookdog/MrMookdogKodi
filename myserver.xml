For over two years, the country had been transfixed by their illicit romance and a violent crime spree that left a trail of dead bodies in its wake. Though their exploits were romanticized, Bonnie and Clyde and their Barrow Gang were believed responsible for at least 13 murders and numerous robberies and kidnappings.

In the years since their deaths, dozens of movies, documentaries and television series have been made glamorizing the lives and deaths of Bonnie and Clyde.</summary>
